About the code:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: It loads a dataset of movie reviews, preprocesses the text data, and splits it into training and testing sets.

Embedding Layer: It constructs an embedding matrix using pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe) for words in the dataset.

Model Training:
Feedforward Neural Network (FNN): It creates a FNN model with an embedding layer, flattening layer, dense layers, and dropout layer.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): It creates a CNN model with an embedding layer, convolutional layer, and pooling layer.
Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM): It creates an LSTM model with an embedding layer and LSTM layer.

Evaluation: It evaluates the trained models on the test set and plots accuracy and loss curves.

Prediction: It makes predictions on unseen movie reviews using the trained LSTM model and saves the predictions along with the movie names and original reviews to a CSV file.

Comparison: It compares the performance of FNN, CNN, and LSTM models based on their test accuracy and F1 scores.

Further Analysis: Finally, it plots the accuracy and loss curves of the models, and compares them based on their F1 scores.

The code seems to be well-structured and comprehensive, covering various aspects of building and evaluating deep learning models for sentiment analysis.
